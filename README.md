# katori
30-key wireless topre/ec hummingbird keyboard based on the [rufous](https://github.com/jcmkk3/trochilidae) & [topreviung](https://gitlab.com/lpgalaxy/topreviung) 
---- 
named after katori senk≈ç mosquito coils that inspired the original conical spring design for topre switches, as well as katori's translation to bird as homage to the hummingbird.

## Status
Not yet tested 

## Manufacturing

Can be hand soldered or ordered assembled using assembly files

Currently setup to use a 1.2mm aluminum single layer pcb as the plate

## Inspiration & Thanks
- jcmkk3's [rufous](https://github.com/jcmkk3/trochilidae#rufous) hummingbird variation, of which I used the Ergogen config and splay etc.
- pete johanson for his incredible help during the project and his [topreviung](https://gitlab.com/lpgalaxy/topreviung) keyboard, which was the basis of the schematic and entire EC portions.
- PJE66's original [hummingbird](https://github.com/PJE66/hummingbird) keyboard
